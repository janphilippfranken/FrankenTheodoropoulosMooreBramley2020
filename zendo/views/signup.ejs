  <h2>Information for participants</h2>

    <p><b>Nature of the study.&nbsp;</b>You are about to participate in an experiment in which you will use your scientific investigation skills. You will collaborate with another player (MTurk worker) and update your initial choices based on the other person's judgments. After the experiment, we will ask you to provide some basic demographics (e.g., age). Your session should last up for around 30 minutes and your responses will be recorded. You will be given full instructions shortly and will be able to ask any questions you may have.</p>

    <p><b>Compensation.&nbsp;</b>You will be paid $1 for your participation and an additional $3.50 if you and the other player successfully complete the task. The maximum additional bonus that can be granted is $2.</p>

    <p><b>Risks and benefits.&nbsp;</b>There are no known risks to participation in this study. Other than the payment mentioned, there are no tangible benefits to you, however you will be contributing to our knowledge about hypothesis generation and social learning.</p>

    <p><b>Confidentiality and use of data.&nbsp;</b>All the information we collect during the course of the research will be processed in accordance with Data Protection Law. In order to safeguard your privacy, we will never share personal information (like names or dates of birth) with anyone outside the research team; if you agree and want to be contacted for future studies, we will add your contact details to our secure participant database. Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name. Please note that we will temporarily collect your worker ID to prevent repeated participation, however we will never share this information with anyone outside the research team. We will store any personal data (e.g., audio/video recordings, signed forms) using a password protected, encrypted hard drive. The anonymized data collected during this study will be used for research purposes. With your permission, identifiable data such as recordings may also be used for research or teaching purposes, and may be shared with other researchers or with the general public (e.g., we may make it available through the world wide web, or use it in TV or radio broadcasts).</p>

    <p><b>What are my data protection rights?&nbsp;</b>The University of Edinburgh is a Data Controller for the information you provide. You have the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with Data Protection Law. You also have other rights including rights of correction, erasure and objection.  For more details, including the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office, please visit www.ico.org.uk.

    <p><b>Voluntary participation and right to withdraw.&nbsp;</b>Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If you withdraw from the study during or after data gathering, we will delete your data and there is no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</p>
