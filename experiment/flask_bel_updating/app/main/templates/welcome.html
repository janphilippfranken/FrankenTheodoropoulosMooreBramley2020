				<h2>Information for participants</h2>
				<div class="scroll_text" id="consent-info">
					<p><b>Nature of the study.&nbsp;</b>You are about to participate in an experiment in which you will imagine that you are a political consultant who travels around the country helping local branches of your political party decide between two competing political candidates. After the experiment, we will ask you you to provide some basic demographics (e.g., age). Your session should last up for around 10-15 minutes and your responses will be recorded. You will be given full instructions shortly and will be able to ask any questions you may have.</p>

					<p><b>Compensation.&nbsp;</b>You will be paid $1.75 for your participation.</p>

					<p><b>Risks and benefits.&nbsp;</b>There are no known risks to participation in this study. Other than the payment mentioned, there no tangible benefits to you, however you will be contributing to our knowledge about reasoning and information integration.</p>

					<p><b>Confidentiality and use of data.&nbsp;</b>All the information we collect during the course of the research will be processed in accordance with Data Protection Law. In order to safeguard your privacy, we will never share personal information (like names or dates of birth) with anyone outside the research team; if you agree and want to be contacted for future studies, we will add your contact details to our secure participant database. Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name. Please note that we will temporarily collect your worker ID to prevent repeated participation, however we will never share this information with anyone outside the research team. We will store any personal data (e.g., audio/video recordings, signed forms) using a password protected, encrypted hard drive. The anonymized data collected during this study will be used for research purposes. With your permission, identifiable data such as recordings may also be used for research or teaching purposes, and may be shared with other researchers or with the general public (e.g., we may make it available through the world wide web, or use it in TV or radio broadcasts).</p>
